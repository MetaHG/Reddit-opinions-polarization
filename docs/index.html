          At the time of this writing, Snoop Dogg has accumulated a respectable amount of 649,567 Karma points on Reddit under his username <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/user/Here_Comes_The_King/comments/”>/u/Here_Comes_The_King</a/>. His main contributions are on the subreddit <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/r/trees>/r/Trees</a>, which you can guess what kind of trees it refers to.

      <h3>A Quick History of Reddit</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a massive public discussion.
        Originally founed in June 2005, Reddit now contains more than 500,000 monthly active users and a total of over 3 billions comments.
        According to a study published by Alexa Internet, reddit it the 3rd most visited website in the United States, and 6th worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Reddit's particularities is its ad-hoc separation of discussions (or "threads") into specific communities (formally named "subreddits").
        <!-- On Reddit, each one of the discussions (or "thread") is linked to a specific community (or "subreddit"). -->
        Each subreddit is a forum of its own, with a specific set of rules and informal codes that members adhere to.
        <!-- has its own set of rules and informal codes that most people adhere to and allow for a constructive and (mostly) civilized discussion. -->
      </p>
      <!-- <br />
      <br />
      These communities are organized around very ..
      Below, one can find the top 10 subreddits in terms of total number of comments. -->
      <!-- Even though that might not be representative of the entire set of comments (as there are a lot of smaller communities for more precise topics), it is interesting to note that 9 out of 10 communities in the top are either about politics or sports. -->

        This also highlights a potential bias in our data, as the set of Reddit users might not be representative of the general population in terms of interests or behaviors.

      <h3>Measuring the Divide</h3>
<!-- - Manually describe all the metrics we came up with -->
<!-- - Analyze the correlation between these metrics at a high-level -->

      The initial part of our research was based around the notion of divisiveness itself.
      Given the available data, how can we measure if a particular discussion is polarized or not?
      What is a sign that a particular topic is controversial?
      In this chapter, we will discuss several metrics that we decided to use in the following study, and motivate our choices.

      <h4>Controversiality</h4>

      For the well-versed redditors, an immediate candidate that comes to mind is Reddit's own controversiality flag.
      Unfortunately, ...

      <h4>Agreement Score</h4>

      One of the first metrics we decided to use was nicknamed the "agreement score".
      It is defined as the number of comments to which the community has reacted positively divided by the total number of comments.
      In order to avoid the noise, we impose a minimum threshold below which comments are not counted.

      <div id="plot-subreddit-agreement" class="plot">

          <h4>Reddit Fun Fact</h4>
          A negative score does not necessarily indicate a polarizing discussion.
          On the blessed day of November 12, 2017, the entire Reddit community came together as a whole to mass down-vote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?context=3">reply from EA Community</a> to a user frustrated about their questionable revenue model on Star Wars Battlefront.
          The comment currently has a score of -667,815 points, the lowest on the entire platform.

      <h3>Natural Language Processing to the Rescue</h3>


      - Positivity
      - Negativity
      - Neutrality

      - Vulgarity
      - Hate Speech

      <h3>Correlations</h3>

      <h3>Failed Attempts</h3>

      - Deleted comments

      <h2>Polarization Over Time</h2>

      One of the primary motivations of this study was to understand how the metrics
      defined above evolved over time.
      Indeed, it is fairly common nowadays to read how polarized our society has become.
      This is often a general feeling, but there are not many studies attempting to actually back this claim with real data.

<!-- EVOLUTION OF DIVISIVENESS -->
<!-- - Plot how the metrics evolved over time -->
<!-- - Try to find other supportive factors, draw conclusions -->

      <h2>"No, you're the most polarized!"</h2>
<!-- POLARIZED COMMUNITIES
- Use the above metrics on specific communities (list of subreddits)
- Extract most polarized communities, what kind of topics, etc..
- Analyze correlation once again -->

      <h2>Case Study: The 2016 American Election</h2>
<!-- CASE STUDY: AMERICAN ELECTIONS 2016
- Analyze for different groups of subreddits
- Analyze per topic / issue
- Analyze per candidate
- Compare with 2012?
- (If it works) LDA -->
