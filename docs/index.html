        In the months following the 2016 American election, many media outlets have reported an increase in social divisiveness and the polarization of political opinions.
        Many of these organizations point at modern social media as a potential cause of this polarization.
        <!-- The intensification of political debates as well as a growing inability to find common grounds are seen as direct consequences of this divide. -->
        <!-- Many of these organizations point at modern social media as a potential cause of this polarization. -->

          <h4>Reddit Fun Fact</h4>
          At the time of this writing, Snoop Dogg has accumulated a respectable amount of 649,567 Karma points on Reddit under his username <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/user/Here_Comes_The_King/comments/”>/u/Here_Comes_The_King</a/>. His main contributions are on the subreddit <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/r/trees>/r/Trees</a>, which you can guess what kind of trees it refers to.

      <h3>A Quick History of Reddit</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> is an American discussion and social news platform where content is created, shared and ranked by the community.
        Originally founed in June 2005, Reddit now contains more than 500,000 monthly active users and a total of over 3 billions comments.
        According to a study published by Alexa Internet, reddit it the 3rd most visited website in the United States, and 6th worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        We highlight two main specificities of Reddit relevant to this study.
        First, the website uses explicit user feedback to evaluate and rank its content.
        This feedback is in the form of a vote ("upvote" for positive and "downvote" for negative) that any user can perform on any post or comment.
        These votes are then aggregated into a single "score" metric, which measures the difference between upvotes and downvotes.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p class="subtext">
        <b>Fun Fact</b> - A negative score does not necessarily indicate a polarizing discussion.
        On the blessed day of November 12, 2017, the entire Reddit community came to an agreement to mass downvote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?context=3">reply from EA Community</a> to a user frustrated about their questionable revenue model on Star Wars Battlefront.
        At the time of this writing, the comment has a score of -667,815 points, the lowest on the entire platform.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Secondly, Reddit imposes a clear ad-hoc separation of its content into disjoint communities (formally named "subreddits").
        Each subreddit is a forum of its own, with a specific set of rules and informal codes that members adhere to.
        They vary from very large communities discussing a broad range of subjects (for instance /r/politics) to smaller niche groups centered around a very specific topic. (e.g. ...).
      </p>

      <!-- <br />

      <hr />

      <p>
        In the chart above, it is already interesting to note that 9 out of the 10 the biggest Reddit communities are related to either politics or sports.
        This highlights a potential bias in our data, as the set of Reddit users might not be representative of the general population in terms of interests or behaviors.
        <!-- The reader will have to keep this in mind throughout the rest of this article. -->
      </p>

      <h3>Finding the Right Metric</h3>

      <p>
        The initial part of our research was based around the notion of divisiveness itself.
        Given the available data, how can we measure if a particular discussion is polarized or not?
        What is a sign that a topic is controversial?
      </p>
      <p>
        In our research, we define polarization as the degree to which people's opinion on a topic are clustered around several extreme, divergent positions.
        In other words, it can be thought of as the lack of a healthy middle-ground in the opinion space of a community.
        Similarly, a particular topic is seen as controversial if it easily creates such a polarization.
        For example, gun control in america is a controversial topic because a people either argue for a complete ban on guns, or total freedom.
        This leaves little room for compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, we quickly realized that polarization itself is a complex, multi-faceted notion that will be hard to measure by itself.
        In order to capture it properly, we therefore decided to keep 4 metrics, each measuring a different aspect or consequence of a controversial topic.
        For each metric, we present its distribution over the dataset and its average over 4 meta-categories of subreddits (compiled with the help of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ListOfSubreddits">/r/ListOfSubreddits</a>).
      </p>

      <hr/>
      <!-- <h4 style='text-align:center;'>Description of Metrics</h4> -->

        <div id="plot-category-metric" class="sub-plot-right"> </div>
      </div>
      <hr/>

      In the plot on the right, we already notice that politics seems to be the most polarizing category.
      It simultaneously exhibits the lowest level agreement and positivity while having the highest negativity and vulgarity.

      <script> plot_category_metric('agreement') </script>

      <h3>A Look at Communities</h3>

      <p>
        With all our metrics properly defined, we are now fully equipped to explore the dataset.
        In particular, let's first have a look at how the different communities of Reddit compare with regards to agreement and positivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the plot below, some things already stand out.
        <a href="https://reddit.com/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, a subreddit dedicated to unconditional fans of Donald Trump, is by far the subreddit with the highest agreement of all.
        We found two possible explanations to this result.
        In the first scenario, this community truly is always in constant agreement, such that only very few comments ever disagree with the general opinion.
        Or, such comments do exist but are systematically removed by the moderation team.
        Either way, this result points towards a general feeling that Redditors visiting this community might have experienced: The_Donald is a big echo chamber.
      </p>

      <hr />
      <h4 style='text-align:center;'>Positivity Versus Agreement Score</h4>
      <div id="plot-subreddit-agreement" class="plot">
        <script> plot_subreddit_agreement('plot-subreddit-agreement') </script>
      </div>
      <div class="legend">
        <!-- The plot above shows the agreement score and positivity of the top 50 biggest subreddits. -->
        <!-- First, we notice that there is no clear correlation between the two metrics. -->

        <!-- This also highlights a potential bias in our data, as the set of Reddit users might not be representative of the general population in terms of interests or behaviors. -->
      </div>
      <hr />

      <p>
        We can also point out the location of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, all of them in the bottom left.
        <!-- All three being non-partisan communities, their status as communities with overall low agreement provides a good comparison point with The_Donald. -->
        With all three being non-partisan communities, their overall low agreement simultaneously supports our hypothesis about The_Donald and provides a good comparison point.
        Moreover, we also notice that the discussions related to politics tend to be the least positive of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side of the plot, we notice that <a href="https://reddit.com/r/aww">/r/aww</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/trees">/r/trees</a> are featured as the most wholesome communities.
        This is not surprising.
        Indeed, the first one is a community dedicated to posting cute pictures of animals.
        The later is a subreddit reserved to regular users of a special kind of "tree", which we leave it to the user to figure out by themselves.

      <h3>Evolution of the Divide</h3>

      <p>
        Another one of our motivations in this study was to understand how the metrics defined above evolved over time.
        It is indeed fairly common nowadays to read about how polarized our society has become.
        This is often cited as a general feeling, but we could not find many studies attempting to actually back this claim with real data.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started by an analysis of how agreement has evolved over time.
        Looking at the results, there is a pretty clear upward trend since 2012, with a sharp increase in 2016.
        Now to be fair, there are many factors that could contribute to such a result.
        For instance, Reddit might have updated their ranking algorithm, such
        But it that the average Reddit user is more in agreement with the content that they interact with.
        This echoes some of our previous results related to the echo chamber phenomenon.
      </p>

      <hr />
      <h4 style='text-align:center;'>The Echo Chamber Effect</h4>
      <br/>
      <div id="plot-daily-agreement" class="sub-plot-left">
        <script> plot_daily_agreement('plot-daily-agreement') </script>
      </div>

      <div id="plot-monthly-contributions" class="sub-plot-right">
        <script> plot_monthly_contributions('plot-monthly-contributions') </script>
      </div>
      <div class="legend">
        On the left, one can see how the agreement factor, despite an initial recess between 2010 and 2012, has since then steadily increased.
        On the right, we see that the  average number of subreddits in which a user participates has decreased by approximately 20% in the same time lapse.
      </div>

      <hr />

      <p>
        This echo chamber argument is also strenghtened by the results found on the right plot.
        There, we can see that this increase in agreement coupled with a 20% decrease in the average number of communities a user interacts with.
        Altogether, this supports a potential explanation that people might have formulated: online communities have become more polarized because users increasingly interact with like-minded individuals.
        But how does that correlates with our other metrics?
      </p>
