          <h4>Reddit Fun Fact</h4>
          At the time of this writing, Snoop Dogg has accumulated a respectable amount of 649,567 Karma points on Reddit under his username <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/user/Here_Comes_The_King/comments/”>/u/Here_Comes_The_King</a/>. His main contributions are on the subreddit <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/r/trees>/r/Trees</a>, which you can guess what kind of trees it refers to.

      <h3>A Quick History of Reddit</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a> is a massive public discussion.
        Originally founed in June 2005, Reddit now contains more than 500,000 monthly active users and a total of over 3 billions comments.
        According to a study published by Alexa Internet, reddit it the 3rd most visited website in the United States, and 6th worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Reddit's particularities is its ad-hoc separation of discussions (or "threads") into specific communities (formally named "subreddits").
        <!-- On Reddit, each one of the discussions (or "thread") is linked to a specific community (or "subreddit"). -->
        Each subreddit is a forum of its own, with a specific set of rules and informal codes that members adhere to.
        <!-- has its own set of rules and informal codes that most people adhere to and allow for a constructive and (mostly) civilized discussion. -->
      </p>
      <!-- <br />
      <br />
      These communities are organized around very ..
      Below, one can find the top 10 subreddits in terms of total number of comments. -->
      <!-- Even though that might not be representative of the entire set of comments (as there are a lot of smaller communities for more precise topics), it is interesting to note that 9 out of 10 communities in the top are either about politics or sports. -->

      </div>

      <hr />

      <p>
        It is interesting to see that 9 out of the 10 the biggest Reddit communities are related to either politics or sports.
        This highlights a potential bias in our data, as the set of Reddit users might not be representative of the general population in terms of interests or behaviors.
        <!-- The reader will have to keep this in mind throughout the rest of this article. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        Another important factor to keep in mind is the way that content is scored on Reddit.
        Like many other forums and social medias platforms, Reddit uses direct user feedback to evaluate and rank posts and comments.
        The system is fairly simple, each user can "upvote" content they like and "downvote" what they do not like.

          <b>Fun Fact</b> - A negative score does not necessarily indicate a polarizing discussion.
          On the blessed day of November 12, 2017, the entire Reddit community came together as a whole to mass down-vote a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/seriously_i_paid_80_to_have_vader_locked/dppum98/?context=3">reply from EA Community</a> to a user frustrated about their questionable revenue model on Star Wars Battlefront.

      <h3>Measuring the Divide</h3>
<!-- - Manually describe all the metrics we came up with -->
<!-- - Analyze the correlation between these metrics at a high-level -->
      <p>
        The initial part of our research was based around the notion of divisiveness itself.
        Given the available data, how can we measure if a particular discussion is polarized or not?
        What is a sign that a particular topic is controversial?
        In this chapter, we will discuss several metrics that we decided to use in the following study, and motivate our choices.

      <p>
        With all our metrics properly defined, we are now fully equipped to explore the dataset.
        In particular, let's first have a look at how the different communities of Reddit compare with regards to agreement and positivity.
        <!-- Looking at the agreement score, something already stands out. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the plot below, some things already stand out.
        <a href="https://reddit.com/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a>, a subreddit dedicated to unconditional fans of Donald Trump, is by far the subreddit with the highest agreement of all.
        We found two possible explanations to this result.
        In the first scenario, this community truly is always in constant agreement, such that only very few comments ever disagree with the general opinion.
        Or, such comments do exist but are systematically removed by the moderation team.
        Either way, this result points towards a general feeling that Redditors visiting this community might have experienced: The_Donald is a big echo chamber.
        <!-- This already hints at an interesting hypothesis: -->
        <!-- A high agreement factor might be indicative of communities which have become big echo chambers. -->
        <!-- A clear lack of indicates that this community either always agrees with everything that users post, or those comments are deleted by the moderation team. -->
        <!-- Either -->
        <!-- Because of the internal structure and visibility mechanisms of Reddit, -->
        <!-- There are two main questions we tried to answer here. -->
        <!-- First of all, what are the characteristics of -->
      </p>

      <!--
      For the well-versed redditors, an immediate candidate that comes to mind is Reddit's own controversiality flag.

      <h4>Agreement Score</h4>

      One of the first metrics we decided to use was nicknamed the "agreement score".
      It is defined as the number of comments to which the community has reacted positively divided by the total number of comments.
      In order to avoid the noise, we impose a minimum threshold below which comments are not counted. -->
      <hr />
      <h4 style='text-align:center;'>Positivity Versus Agreement Score</h4>
      <div id="plot-subreddit-agreement" class="plot">
        <script> plot_subreddit_agreement('plot-subreddit-agreement') </script>
      </div>
      <div class="legend">
        <!-- The plot above shows the <b>agreement score</b> and <b>positivity</b> of each of our top 50 subreddits. -->
        <!-- First, we notice that there is no clear correlation between the two metrics. -->
        <!-- The most -->
        <!-- In the plot above, one can see that there is not clear correlation between -->
        <!-- Even though ..., it is interesting to note 9 out of the 10 the biggest communities are related to either politics (blue) or sports (orange). -->
        <!-- This also highlights a potential bias in our data, as the set of Reddit users might not be representative of the general population in terms of interests or behaviors. -->
      </div>
      <hr />

      <p>
        We can also point out the location of <a href="https://reddit.com/r/worldnews">/r/worldnews</a>, <a href="https://reddit.com/r/news">/r/news</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/politics">/r/politics</a>, all of them in the bottom left.
        <!-- All three being non-partisan communities, their status as communities with overall low agreement provides a good comparison point with The_Donald. -->
        With all three being non-partisan communities, their overall low agreement simultaneously supports our hypothesis about The_Donald and provides a good comparison point.
        Moreover, we also notice that the discussions related to politics tend to be the least positive of all.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side of the plot, we notice that <a href="https://reddit.com/r/aww">/r/aww</a> and <a href="https://reddit.com/r/trees">/r/trees</a> are featured as the most wholesome communities.
        This is not surprising.
        Indeed, the first one is a community dedicated to posting cute pictures of animals.
        The later is a subreddit reserved to regular users of a special kind of "tree".
        (Hint - Snoop Dogg used to be a big contributor of this community, accumulating a respectable amount of 649,567 Reddit Karma points on his main account <a href=“https://www.reddit.com/user/Here_Comes_The_King/”>/u/Here_Comes_The_King</a/>)

      <h2>Polarization Over Time</h2>

      <p>
        Another one of our motivations in this study was to understand how the metrics defined above evolved over time.
        It is indeed fairly common nowadays to read about how polarized our society has become.
        This is often cited as a general feeling, but we could not find many studies attempting to actually back this claim with real data.
      </p>
      Plotting the above metrics as a function of time gives us interesting results.

      <div class="legend">
        On the left, one can see how the agreement factor, despite an initial recess between 2010 and 2012, has since then steadily increased.
        On the right, we see that the  average number of subreddits in which a user participates has decreased by approximately 20% in the same time lapse.
      </div>

      <hr />

      Looking at this plot, we notice a continuous increase in the agreement of people with each other.
      This is interesting, because it highlights one of the potential root causes of this phenomenon.
      <!-- This is interesting, because it suggests  -->
      The division does not come from people disagreeing with each other.
      It stems from a diminution of how much people with diverging opinions interact with each other.
