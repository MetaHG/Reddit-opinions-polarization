    "It is widely accepted and recognized in the political sphere that the U.S. 2016 presidential election greatly divided the U.S. citizens. As early as January 2016 [journalists were already reporting that the rethoric used by the various presidential candidates were unusually violent and agressive, resulting in a division among the opinions of the american people](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/a-divided-country-gets-a-divisive-election/2016/01/09/591bfccc-b61f-11e5-a842-0feb51d1d124_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.54c240a270e9). A division which kept on growing through the year as the presidential candidates were striked by diverse controversies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although Reddit discussions do not represent the voice of all american people, many subreddits served as a hub for internet users entitled in voicing their support for the candidate they wished would win. This provides us some natural aggregation of the opinions of people supporting each side of the election. [r/The_Donald]() and [r/hillaryclinton]() were the main subreddits for reddit users standing respectively for the Republican and the Democrat candidate. In order to observe the divisiveness, we chose to take a more specialized look to what were the most discussed topics in each community the week preceding the election day. However such communities suffer from the natural echo chamber effect as highlighted before by the agreement factor from The_Donald being one of the highest among the bid subreddit. Thus we compare such topics with the ones discussed on r/news which will serve as a neutral ground of observation between the candidates respective communities. The agreement factor of the news subreddit being one of the lowest indicates the echo chamber effect has a lesser impact on this subreddit's threads. \n",

    "\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) was the unsupervised clustering method we chose in order to model Reddit discussions topics. Given a corpus of documents and a topic's number, LDA assumes that each document is the produce of a mixture of the given number of topic. We can thus infer the topic that might be the subject of the documents collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we chose the documents to be directly the reddit comments, as it is the unit of a Reddit discussion. Some classic natural language preprocessing has to be done for LDA to work properly. Thus each comment was first tokenized, then cleaned of any english stop words and finally lemmatized. Through experiences, some more preprocessing had to be done in order to remove idiosyncracies of Reddit comments:\n",
